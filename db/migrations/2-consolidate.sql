-- The query below consolidates vehicles that have similar names together:

-- Step #1: Change the id in assignments table to smallest id amongst consolidated vehicles

-- Consolidating Van A
update assignments
set vehicle = 6
Where vehicle IN (29, 24, 23, 31);

-- Consolidating Bus B
update assignments
set vehicle = 11
Where vehicle IN (30, 12, 33);

-- Consolidating Van C
update assignments
set vehicle = 14
Where vehicle IN (34);

-- Consolidating Van D
update assignments
set vehicle = 18
Where vehicle IN (27,28,45,32);

-- Consolidating Facilities Truck
update assignments
set vehicle = 39
Where vehicle IN (40);

-- Consolidating Van H
update assignments
set vehicle = 20
Where vehicle IN (37,36);

-- Consolidating Van I
update assignments
set vehicle = 26
Where vehicle IN (38);


-- Step #2: Delete ids that are no longer in use from the vehicles table

DELETE FROM vehicles
WHERE id IN (29, 24, 23, 31, 30, 12, 33, 34, 27,28,45,32,40,37,36,38);
