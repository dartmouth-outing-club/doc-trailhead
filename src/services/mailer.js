/**
 * Create a function that can be run on a schedule to send emails.
 *
 * We have certain emails that need to be sent out regularly to check in with the status of
 * various trips. This function creates a new function that can be run on a schedule to
 * accomplish that for each of the different types of emails we need to send. The reason
 * for the mildly complex currying here is that we have to be careful about how we send the
 * emails, since there is a limit on the number of concurrent connections that we can
 * establish with the Office365 email servers.
 *
 * The functions created here will send each of the emails synchronously, but won't block
 * the event loop waiting for each one. This would be suboptimal for an API (it takes
 * a minute), but is totally reasonable for a scheduled email, where reliability is key and
 * a difference of minutes is totally unnoticable to the user.
